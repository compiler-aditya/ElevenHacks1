# Dashboard

Follow this guide to create a Workers application using the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Prerequisites

[Create a Cloudflare account](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/create-account/), if you have not already.

## Setup

To get started with a new Workers application:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.
    [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
2. Select **Create application**. From here, you can:
   - Select from the gallery of production-ready templates
   - Import an existing Git repository on your own account
   - Let Cloudflare clone and bootstrap a public repository containing a Workers application.
3. Once you have connected to your chosen [Git provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/), configure your project and select **Deploy**.

4. Cloudflare will kick off a new build and deployment. Once deployed, preview your Worker at its provided `workers.dev` subdomain.


## Continue development

Applications started in the dashboard are set up with Git to help kickstart your development workflow. To continue developing on your repository, you can run:

```
# clone your repository locally

git clone <git repo URL>

# make sure you are in the root directory

cd <directory>
```

Now, you can preview and test your changes by [running Wrangler in your local development environment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/). Once you are ready to deploy you can run:

```
# adds the files to git tracking

git add .

# commits the changes

git commit -m "your message"

# push the changes to your Git provider

git push origin main
```
