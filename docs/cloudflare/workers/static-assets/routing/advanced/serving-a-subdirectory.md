# Serving a subdirectory

Like with any other Worker, [you can configure a Worker with assets to run on a path of your domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/).
Assets defined for a Worker must be nested in a directory structure that mirrors the desired path.

For example, to serve assets from `example.com/blog/*`, create a `blog` directory in your asset directory.

- Directorydist


  - Directoryblog


    - index.html
    - Directoryposts


      - post1.html
      - post2.html

With a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) like so:

- [wrangler.jsonc](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/advanced/serving-a-subdirectory/#tab-panel-8980)
- [wrangler.toml](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/advanced/serving-a-subdirectory/#tab-panel-8981)

```
{

  "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",

  "name": "assets-on-a-path-example",

  "main": "src/index.js",

  "route": "example.com/blog/*",

  "assets": {

    "directory": "dist"

  }

}
```

```
"$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"

name = "assets-on-a-path-example"

main = "src/index.js"

route = "example.com/blog/*"

[assets]

directory = "dist"
```

In this example, requests to `example.com/blog/` will serve the `index.html` file, and requests to `example.com/blog/posts/post1` will serve the `post1.html` file.

If you have a file outside the configured path, it will not be served, unless it is part of the `assets.not_found_handling` for [Single Page Applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/single-page-application/) or [custom 404 pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/static-site-generation/). For example, if you have a `home.html` file in the root of your asset directory, it will not be served when requesting `example.com/blog/home`. However, if needed, these files can still be manually fetched over [the binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/binding/#binding).
